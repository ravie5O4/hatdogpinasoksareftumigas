Lalovee, Happy 2nd Monthsaryyy! It's hard to believe that our journey together has only been underway for two months.
Every second I've spent with you has been a gift and a living example of the strength of love.
Despite the arguments and the distance between us, our love continues to grow stronger and I am constantly in awe of how deeply I have fallen for you.
I find that just thinking about you makes me happy, and I look forward to the time when I can see you again. I am so grateful to have you in my life because your love, laughter, 
and kindness have brought me so much happiness. I am incredibly proud to call you my rock, my best friend, and my soulmate. I promise to always stand by your side, to love you unconditionally, and to support you through thick and thin.
I am looking forward to a lifetime of creating unforgettable memories and building a future together, where we can finally be together, 
hand in hand.I can't wait to see what the future holds for us, I LOVE YOU 3000</3
